### TODO

* Change the ship graphics to be more subtle with colour strips rather than being full colour

* Fix ship parts so they don't overlap and have a way of editing and viewing them

* Update the main menu with some better graphics and something more visually interesting/moving

* Add RPG elements to the game, selecting ship crew and leveling them up

* Adding enemies to the game

* Giving the enemies a "Legionary" structure of groups of 8, 80 and 800 and so on

* Add some additional libraries... 
    * They are added as an addendum
    * They are suggested to be used to solve problems
