- **Visual Effects**: Glow, trail, pulse effects as appropriate
- **Color Integration**: Automatic color adaptation based on ship color scheme

#### Part Types
Parts are categorized by function:

✅ All detailed configurations implemented with proper TypeScript types
✅ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
✅ No errors in any game files (Engine.ts, Player.ts, SpriteRenderer.ts)
✅ Development server running successfully
✅ Parts available for use in ship creation system
✅ Both legacy and detailed rendering modes supported

### Ship Parts Debugging Feature

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Ship Configuration Panel
- **Collapsible Debug Section**: Added an accordion-style "Ship Parts Debug" panel
- **Individual Part Controls**: Checkbox for each ship part (hull, wings, engines, etc.)
- **Quick Actions**: "All" and "None" buttons for rapid testing scenarios
- **Visual States**: Disabled parts are grayed out in the interface
- **Responsive Design**: Panel adjusts height and includes scrolling for smaller screens

#### 2. Dynamic Ship Assembly System
- **Conditional Part Creation**: Ship parts are only instantiated if enabled
- **Real-time Updates**: Configuration changes apply immediately
- **Memory Optimization**: Disabled parts don't consume rendering resources
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

#### 3. Ship Type Support
All ship types now support part debugging:
- **Compact Fighter**: Hull, Wings, Thrusters
- **Assault Cruiser**: Hull, Wings, Dual Engine
- **Capital Ship**: Hull, Quad Engine, Side Cannons
- **Interceptor Variants**: Individual hulls, shared wings and engines

### Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified
1. **ShipConfigPanel.tsx**: Added debug accordion with part toggles
2. **Player.ts**: Enhanced to respect enabledParts configuration
3. **Engine.ts**: Updated to pass enabledParts to player
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides created

#### Interface Extensions
```typescript
// Enhanced ShipConfig interface
interface ShipConfig {
    type: ShipTypes;
    color: ShipColor;
    enabledParts?: { [key: string]: boolean }; // NEW
}

// Enhanced PlayerConfig interface  
interface PlayerConfig {
    // ...existing properties...
    enabledParts?: { [key: string]: boolean }; // NEW
}
```

#### Smart Part Management
```typescript
// Conditional part creation logic
const addPartIfEnabled = (partKey: string, partComponent: () => ShipPart) => {
    if (!config.enabledParts || config.enabledParts[partKey] !== false) {
        parts.push({ component: partComponent(), key: partKey });
    }
};
```

### Usage for Debugging

#### Common Debugging Scenarios
1. **Collision Testing**: Disable wings to test hull-only physics
2. **Visual Analysis**: Remove parts to examine internal structure  
3. **Performance Testing**: Test with minimal parts for optimization
4. **Component Isolation**: Test individual part behaviors
5. **Art Direction**: Experiment with visual compositions

#### How to Use
1. Launch application in test mode
2. Open ship configuration panel (top-right)
3. Expand "Ship Parts Debug" accordion
4. Toggle individual parts using checkboxes
5. Use "All"/"None" for quick state changes
6. Changes apply immediately to ship visualization

### Benefits Delivered
