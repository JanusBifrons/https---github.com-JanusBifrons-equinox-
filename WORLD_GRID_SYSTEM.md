# World Grid System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive world grid system implemented for the Equinox space combat game, based on the Grid class example provided. The system provides an infinite, dynamic grid that follows the camera and responds to zoom levels.

## Key Features

### 1. **Infinite World Grid**
- Grid extends infinitely in all directions
- Only renders visible grid sections for optimal performance
- Grid follows camera movement seamlessly
- Based on camera position calculations similar to the provided Grid class

### 2. **Two-Tier Grid System**
- **Major Grid Lines**: Every 500 units with 2px line width
- **Minor Grid Lines**: Every 50 units with 1px line width
- Minor grid automatically hides at low zoom levels (< 0.3) for clarity

### 3. **Game Mode Specific Styling**
- **Classic Mode**: Standard gray grid (0x444444 major, 0x333333 minor)
- **Practice Mode**: Enhanced visibility (0x555555 major, 0x444444 minor)
- **Survival Mode**: Red-tinted grid (0x440000 major, 0x330000 minor)
- **Test Mode**: High visibility grid (0x666666 major, 0x444444 minor)

### 4. **Dynamic Camera Integration**
- Grid recalculates visible area based on camera world position
- Updates automatically when camera moves or zooms
- Parallax effect: grid moves at 0.8x camera speed for depth perception
- Grid lines snap to world coordinates, not screen coordinates

### 5. **Performance Optimizations**
- Only draws 10x10 major grid cells around camera position
- Minor grid conditional rendering based on zoom level
- Efficient grid clearing and redrawing on camera updates
- Uses PIXI.Graphics for hardware-accelerated rendering

## Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithm (Based on Grid Class Example)

```typescript
// Calculate camera position in world space
const cameraWorldX = this.cameraTarget ? this.cameraTarget.position.x : 0;
const cameraWorldY = this.cameraTarget ? this.cameraTarget.position.y : 0;

// Calculate grid offset based on camera position
const startX = (Math.round(cameraWorldX / majorGridSize) * majorGridSize) - (majorGridSize * (gridArea / 2));
const startY = (Math.round(cameraWorldY / majorGridSize) * majorGridSize) - (majorGridSize * (gridArea / 2));
```

### Grid Configuration

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Major Grid Size | 500 units | Spacing between thick grid lines |
| Minor Grid Size | 50 units | Spacing between thin grid lines |
| Grid Area | 10 cells | Number of major cells drawn in each direction |
| Major Line Width | 2px | Thickness of major grid lines |
| Minor Line Width | 1px | Thickness of minor grid lines |

### Camera Integration Points

1. **updateCamera()** - Updates grid for normal game modes
2. **updateTestModeCamera()** - Updates grid for test mode
3. **resize()** - Recreates grid when screen size changes
4. **createGrid()** - Initial grid setup and worldGrid assignment

## Visual Examples

### Grid Hierarchy
```
Major Grid (500 units)
├── Minor Grid (50 units)
├── Minor Grid (50 units)
├── ...
├── Minor Grid (50 units)
└── Major Grid (500 units)
```

### Zoom Behavior
- **High Zoom (> 0.3)**: Both major and minor grid visible
- **Low Zoom (≤ 0.3)**: Only major grid visible for clarity
- **Dynamic**: Grid lines maintain world-space positioning regardless of zoom

## Code Structure

### New Components
- `worldGrid: PIXI.Graphics | null` - The grid graphics object
- `updateWorldGrid()` - Core grid rendering method
- Enhanced `createGrid()` - Grid initialization with world grid setup

### Modified Components
- `updateCamera()` - Calls `updateWorldGrid()` after camera position updates
- `updateTestModeCamera()` - Calls `updateWorldGrid()` for test mode
- `resize()` - Recreates grid on screen size changes

## Performance Characteristics

### Optimizations
1. **Culling**: Only renders 10x10 grid area around camera
2. **Conditional Rendering**: Minor grid hidden at low zoom
3. **Efficient Clearing**: Uses `clear()` instead of destroying/recreating graphics
4. **Snap-to-Grid**: Grid calculation snaps to world boundaries for consistency

### Expected Performance
- **Grid Updates**: ~60 FPS with smooth camera movement
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal - single PIXI.Graphics object
- **CPU Usage**: Low - grid updates only when camera moves/zooms

## Comparison to Original Grid Class

| Original Grid Class | Equinox Implementation |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Canvas 2D Context | PIXI.Graphics (WebGL) |
| nSize = 5000 | majorGridSize = 500 |
| nGridSize = 10 | gridArea = 10 |
| nSmallGridSize = 10 | minorGridSize = 50 |
| nThick/nThin = 2/1 | majorLineWidth/minorLineWidth = 2/1 |
| Manual offset calculation | Integrated with PIXI camera system |

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Minimap Integration
The world grid system works seamlessly with the enhanced minimap:
- Minimap shows its own grid overlay at minimap scale
- World grid provides spatial reference in main game view
- Both systems use similar major/minor grid concepts

### Star Field Integration  
- Grid renders in background layer behind stars
- Parallax effects maintain proper depth ordering
- Grid updates don't interfere with star field parallax

### Camera System Integration
- World grid position updates automatically with camera
- Zoom-responsive rendering maintains visual clarity
- Test mode and normal mode both supported

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Grid Labels**: Add coordinate labels at major grid intersections
2. **Adaptive Spacing**: Adjust grid spacing based on zoom level
3. **Custom Colors**: User-configurable grid colors
4. **Grid Snapping**: Objects snap to grid lines in editor mode
5. **Origin Marker**: Special styling for world origin (0,0)

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Viewport Culling**: More precise visible area calculation
2. **Level-of-Detail**: Multiple grid densities based on zoom
3. **Caching**: Cache grid geometry for repeated camera positions

## Testing & Validation

### Test Scenarios
1. **Camera Movement**: Grid follows smoothly without gaps
2. **Zoom In/Out**: Minor grid appears/disappears appropriately  
3. **Game Mode Switch**: Grid styling updates correctly
4. **Screen Resize**: Grid adapts to new screen dimensions
5. **Performance**: Maintains 60 FPS during rapid camera movement

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Grid extends infinitely in all directions
- ✅ Major/minor grid hierarchy visible
- ✅ Game mode specific styling applied
- ✅ Zoom-responsive rendering
- ✅ Smooth camera integration
- ✅ Performance maintained

## Conclusion

The world grid system successfully implements the infinite grid concept from the provided Grid class example, adapted for PIXI.js and integrated with the Equinox game engine. It provides spatial reference, enhances navigation, and maintains visual consistency across all game modes while delivering excellent performance and smooth camera integration.
