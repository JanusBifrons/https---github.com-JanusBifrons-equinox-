- **Scale**: Dynamic based on screen size
- **Updates**: Real-time position tracking for all objects

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details - Physics Fix

### Ship Parts Speed Issue Resolution
**Problem**: Ship parts were flying off at tremendous speed during destruction, making them impossible to track visually.

**Root Cause**: The force application was using values that were too large for Matter.js physics engine:
```javascript
// BEFORE (problematic):
const speed = 3;
const force = { x: (Math.random() - 0.5) * speed, y: (Math.random() - 0.5) * speed };
// This resulted in forces ranging from -1.5 to +1.5, which are extremely high for Matter.js
```

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Reduced Force Magnitude**: Changed from `speed = 3` to `explosionStrength = 0.008`
2. **Added Initial Velocity**: Set immediate velocity instead of relying only on forces
3. **Improved Physics Properties**: Adjusted mass, friction, and air resistance

```javascript
// AFTER (fixed):
const explosionStrength = 0.008; // Much smaller force for realistic physics
const force = { x: (Math.random() - 0.5) * explosionStrength, y: (Math.random() - 0.5) * explosionStrength };
const initialVelocity = { x: (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2, y: (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2 };
Matter.Body.setVelocity(partBody, initialVelocity);
```

**Physics Parameters Tuned**:
- **Force**: 0.008 (was 3.0) - 375x reduction
- **Mass**: 0.5 (was 0.3) - More stable movement
- **Air Resistance**: 0.03 (was 0.02) - Faster deceleration
- **Restitution**: 0.4 (was 0.7) - Less bouncy collisions
- **Angular Velocity**: 0.3 (was 0.5) - Slower rotation

## ðŸŽ‰ Result
The ship destruction mechanics are now fully functional with beautiful visual effects, smooth camera movement, and an intuitive testing interface. The minimap has been repositioned for optimal visibility during testing, and all destroyed parts are properly tracked and displayed.

**Ship parts now move at realistic speeds** with proper physics behavior, making the destruction effect visually impressive and easy to follow with the camera system!
